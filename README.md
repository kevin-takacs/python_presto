## SYNOPIS:

Python Presto is a starting template for a general Python program.  In addition
to few helper functions to do common tasks, the program provides a convenient
way to pass options and argument from the command line to the program.

## EXAMPLE:

$ ./python_presto_v1.0.py --debug --emailto foo@bar.com parse_this.csv

In the above example, the program is being run with the *debug* option set to
*True* and the *emailto* option set to *foo@bar.com* the argument
*parse_this.csv* is passed. In this example, it's a file handle, but it doesn't
have to be.
